## Core Components

### Agents

Agents are the heart of your CrewAI system. Each agent is an autonomous AI entity with a specific role, goal, and personality.

#### Agent Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `role` | str | ✅ | The agent's job title and primary function |
| `goal` | str | ✅ | The agent's main objective and purpose |
| `backstory` | str | ✅ | Background context that shapes the agent's behavior |
| `tools` | List[Tool] | ❌ | Tools available to the agent |
| `llm` | LLM | ❌ | Language model to use (defaults to OpenAI GPT-4) |
| `verbose` | bool | ❌ | Enable detailed logging |
| `allow_delegation` | bool | ❌ | Allow agent to delegate tasks to others |

    backstory="""You are a seasoned data analyst with 10+ years of experience
                 in statistical analysis and data visualization. You have a keen
                 eye for patterns and can translate complex data into actionable insights.""",
    tools=[data_analysis_tool, visualization_tool],
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    max_iter=5
)
```

#### Agent Best Practices

1. **Clear Role Definition**: Make roles specific and focused
2. **Compelling Backstory**: Provide context that influences decision-making
3. **Appropriate Tools**: Equip agents with tools relevant to their role
4. **Goal Alignment**: Ensure agent goals support overall crew objectives

### Tasks

Tasks are specific assignments that define what each agent should accomplish. Well-defined tasks are crucial for successful crew execution.

#### Task Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | str | ✅ | Detailed instructions for the task |
| `expected_output` | str | ✅ | Clear description of the desired outcome |
| `agent` | Agent | ✅ | The agent responsible for this task |

    Use reliable sources and provide citations.
    """,
    expected_output="""
    A structured research report containing:
    - Executive summary (200 words)
    - Detailed findings for each focus area (500 words each)
    - List of sources with proper citations
    - Key statistics and data points
    """,
    agent=researcher,
    tools=[web_search_tool, data_analysis_tool]
)

# Example: Analysis Task with Context
analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the research findings and identify the top 5 trends",
    expected_output="A prioritized list of trends with impact assessment",
    agent=analyst,
    context=[research_task]  # Uses output from research_task
)
```

#### Task Best Practices

1. **Specific Instructions**: Provide step-by-step guidance
2. **Clear Outcomes**: Define exactly what success looks like
3. **Appropriate Scope**: Keep tasks focused and manageable
4. **Context Dependencies**: Use task context for sequential workflows

### Tools

Tools extend agent capabilities by providing access to external resources, APIs, and specialized functions.

#### Built-in Tools

CrewAI provides several pre-built tools:

```python
from crewai_tools import (
    SerperDevTool,      # Web search
    ScrapeWebsiteTool,  # Website scraping
    FileReadTool,       # File operations
    DirectoryReadTool,  # Directory operations
    CodeDocsSearchTool, # Code documentation search
    YoutubeChannelSearchTool,  # YouTube search
    GithubSearchTool    # GitHub repository search
)

# Initialize tools
search_tool = SerperDevTool()
scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()
file_tool = FileReadTool()
```

#### Custom Tools

Create custom tools for specific needs:

```python
from crewai_tools import BaseTool
from typing import Type
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class CalculatorInput(BaseModel):
    """Input schema for Calculator."""
    expression: str = Field(..., description="Mathematical expression to evaluate")

class CalculatorTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Calculator"
    description: str = "Useful for mathematical calculations"
    args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = CalculatorInput

    def _run(self, expression: str) -> str:
        try:
            result = eval(expression)
            return f"The result of {expression} is {result}"
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error calculating {expression}: {str(e)}"

# Use the custom tool
calculator = CalculatorTool()
```

#### Tool Integration

```python
# Assign tools to agents
researcher = Agent(
    role='Research Specialist',
    goal='Gather and analyze information',
    backstory='Expert researcher with analytical skills',
    tools=[search_tool, scrape_tool, file_tool]
)

# Or assign tools to specific tasks
research_task = Task(
    description='Research AI trends',
    expected_output='Comprehensive report',
    agent=researcher,
    tools=[search_tool]  # Task-specific tools
)
```

1.4. Processes: The Workflow

A Process defines the workflow for how your agents will execute their assigned tasks. It’s the difference between a chaotic free-for-all and a well-managed assembly line. It tells Agent A to finish their job completely before handing off the results to Agent B.

The most common and default workflow is the Sequential Process.

In a sequential process, tasks are completed one after another, in a specific order. The output of the first task is passed along to the next, creating a logical chain of work. For example, first, a researcher agent completes its task of gathering information. Only after it's finished is that information passed to the writer agent to complete its task.

You now understand all the individual parts. Let's see how they come together to form a Crew.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Assembling the Crew

You've met the individual members of your team (Agents), written their to-do lists (Tasks), and given them their special equipment (Tools). Now, as the project manager, it's time to assemble them into a Crew and define their Process.

The Crew is the final component that brings everything together and manages the entire operation. Assembling your crew involves three simple steps:

1. Define your Agents: List the specialist AI workers you need for the job.
2. Define their Tasks: Create the detailed to-do list for your agents.
3. Form the Crew: Combine your agents and tasks, and set the process (e.g., sequential) that they will follow.

Once your crew is fully assembled, you use the .kickoff() method to begin the work. Think of kickoff() as the "start button" that sets your AI team in motion to achieve the goal.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Your Path Forward

Congratulations! You now have a solid foundation for understanding the core concepts of the CrewAI framework. By learning how these simple but powerful components work together, you've taken your first step into the exciting world of AI agents.

Let's recap the fundamental building blocks you've learned:

* Agents: Your specialized AI workers.
* Tasks: The specific assignments for your agents.
* Tools: The special abilities you give your agents.
* Process: The workflow that dictates how tasks are done.
* Crew: The manager that brings it all together.

Think of your first CrewAI project like directing a small film. You've cast your actors (Agents), given them a script (Tasks), provided them with props (Tools), and set the scene-by-scene shooting order (Process). The Crew is you, the director, calling 'Action!' with the .kickoff() method.

Now it's time to start experimenting. Go ahead and build your first crew!

## Advanced Features

### Memory and Learning

CrewAI supports different types of memory to enhance agent performance:

```python
from crewai import Crew
from crewai.memory import LongTermMemory, ShortTermMemory

crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    memory=True,  # Enable basic memory
    # Or use specific memory types
    long_term_memory=LongTermMemory(),
    short_term_memory=ShortTermMemory()
)
```

### Callbacks and Monitoring

Monitor crew execution with callbacks:

```python
def task_callback(output):
    print(f"Task completed: {output}")

def step_callback(step):
    print(f"Step executed: {step}")

crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    step_callback=step_callback
)

task = Task(
    description="Analyze data",
    expected_output="Analysis report",
    agent=analyst,
    callback=task_callback
)
```

### Custom LLMs

Use different language models:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI, Anthropic
from crewai import Agent

# Using different LLMs for different agents
researcher = Agent(
    role='Researcher',
    goal='Research topics',
    backstory='Expert researcher',
    llm=OpenAI(model_name="gpt-4")
)

writer = Agent(
    role='Writer',
    goal='Write content',
    backstory='Skilled writer',
    llm=Anthropic(model="claude-3-sonnet")
)
```
